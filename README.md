The idea of MyMusicHere project is to automate the process
of publishing sheet music that was typeset with the
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) system.

The project includes two repositories.
This repository contains the source code of sheet music.
The [second repository](http://github.com/dmitrvk/mymusichere.me)
contains the source code of the [website](http://www.mymusichere.me).

[![score](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitrvk/mymusichere/master/score.png)](https://www.mymusichere.me)

Each score has a unique
[slug](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/glossary/#term-slug).
This allows to create a simple and readable URL for each score, for example,
[https://www.mymusichere.me/june](https://www.mymusichere.me/june).
